# Om Network

This application's intent is to allow its users to easily set up exchanges between one another.

Each user comes with its own page (called spaces), containing the resources it offers and needs, in the forms of modules attached to its space.

Groups are a way for different users to gather their resources to help manage communities
and provide more complex services/merge common needs.
